# miniCTF â€“ Challenge List

Welcome to **miniCTF**

> This entire platform â€” from the design to the challenges â€” was built in just **one day**.
> 
> So yeah, some things might be a little rough around the edges or feel incomplete. But thatâ€™s part of the charm.
> 
> Every challenge is handcrafted, and while it might not be perfect, it's built with love for learning and curiosity.

Below is a list of the challenges included in this CTF with their descriptions and point values.

## Challenges

### ðŸ”¹ Fragments of the City â€“ 25 pts  
> End City holds secrets layered upon layers â€” not meant to be read, but peeled.  
> Youâ€™ve found a data fragment left behind by something â€” or someone â€” who tried to send a message out. But to read it, youâ€™ll have to decode the chaos.  
>  
> **Hint**: Think recursively. Think base by base.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Language of The Void â€“ 50 pts  
> Youâ€™ve ventured deep into The Endâ€¦ but something is whispering back.  
> We intercepted a strange transmission â€” written in a language only Endermen understand.  
> Can you understand what itâ€™s trying to say?

---

### ðŸ”¹ Weird User Agent â€“ 100 pts  
> One of the HTTP requests looks suspicious â€” especially the browser being used.  
> Can you find the flag?  
>  
> The flag is hidden in plain sight.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Zipped Intel â€“ 250 pts  
> Thereâ€™s a **file** from an internal server that raised some red flags.  
> We believe the file may contain sensitive information â€” but itâ€™s not that easy to get to.  
> Inspect the network capture and retrieve the hidden flag.

---

### ðŸ”¹ format-frenzy â€“ 200 pts  
> The binary contains a format string vulnerability.  
> The flag is hidden in memory but not printed or returned anywhere.  
> Exploiting the format string bug allows us to leak the memory and retrieve the flag.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Deep Dive â€“ 50 pts  
> This massive file came from a mysterious solo architect.  
> Itâ€™s packed with junk data, red herrings, and maybe... a real flag.  
>  
> **Hint**: Things may be reversed. Trust no flag at first glance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Old Habits Die Hard â€“ 10 pts  
> Itâ€™s 2025. But some people are still using passwords like itâ€™s 1999.  
> We found this hash sitting on an old dev server.  
> Can you figure out what bad habit they still havenâ€™t broken?

---

### ðŸ”¹ Now You Donâ€™t â€“ 200 pts  
> We checked the file. You checked the file. Itâ€™s just one line, right?  
>  
> But something doesn't feel right.  
> The file size is way too big for just one line.  
> Maybe thereâ€™s more there... even if you canâ€™t see it.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Lost and Found â€“ 80 pts  
> Somewhere, in this maze of folders, lies your prize.  
> We didnâ€™t hide it *that* well...  
> Did we?  
>  
> There are 100 folders. Only one contains the flag. Good luck, explorer.
